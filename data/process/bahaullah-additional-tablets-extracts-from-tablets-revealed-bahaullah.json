The following two blessed verses have been revealed in that most exalted, most holy Tablet: “Amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honour. Say: What manner of man art thou, O vain and heedless one, who wouldst appear as other than thou art? And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge, and still deeper knowledge concealed within this knowledge. Say: Thou speakest false! By God! What thou dost possess is naught but husks which We have left to thee as bones are left to dogs.” Observe how every vain and worthless soul hath caused a narrow gulf to branch out from the most great Ocean and, prompted by idle imaginings and corrupt desires, hath provoked divisions amongst the people of Islám through evil scheming and deceptions."

What he hath mentioned is undoubtedly the truth. All people must, however, fix their gaze upon the Word that hath dawned from the horizon of Divine Utterance. It is incumbent upon every soul to ponder its sovereignty and pervading influence, its might and all‑encompassing power. There can be no doubt that these matters are confirmed and proven only through the Word of God. It is the Word of God that standeth supreme over all things. It is the begetter of the world and the educator of its people. It summoneth them that wander athirst in the vale of separation to direct their steps towards the ocean of reunion. It illuminateth the darkness of ignorance with the morning light of knowledge."

This, despite the fact that it is clear and evident to every possessor of insight and understanding that, to outward seeming, no such sacrifice took place, and all agree that an animal was sacrificed. Meditate, therefore, on the reason why a person that hath gone to the altar of sacrifice for the Beloved and yet hath come back alive was clothed with the robe of divine sacrifice and was invested with the ornament of His acceptance. There is no doubt that he attained this station and was adorned with this mantle through the agency of the Word of God. Thus, the appearance, the realisation, and the fulfilment of every name, station, and created thing are all dependent upon the Word of God."

Second is possession of the means of travel, whether financial or otherwise. Most important, however, is obtaining permission prior to departure. Should all these conditions be fulfilled and yet wisdom dictate otherwise, it is not permissible to undertake the journey.

Among them is the letter Káf, who is the recipient of His unsurpassed mercy. Thus do We make mention of him in this Tablet with the sweet melodies of the pure in heart. Another is the letter Qáf, who journeyed unto the court of God in His days and is reckoned among the righteous. Likewise the letter Há’, who embarked on this journey, hath returned home by Our leave, and is now immersed in the ocean of divine love. The letter Rá’ is yet another one who hearkened to the wondrous melodies of the Nightingale and entered beneath the sheltering shadow of God, the Gracious, the All Knowing. And among them are such as have left their homes and since returned. We have not mentioned their names, but all have attained a station of grace that is beyond the comprehension of all created things. Erelong will God reveal unto them the fruits of their noble deeds, as they soar into the blessed heaven of holiness on wings of ruby. There are still others who have made this journey in their hearts and whose names were inscribed with the Pen of power upon the spirits of transcendent glory. Soon will God open before their faces the portals of Paradise and they will enter therein in a state of peace and mercy from Our presence and abide there forever in bliss."

Blessed is the man who will read it and ponder the verses sent down in it by the omnipotent, self‑subsisting Lord. The reason was this: Over the course of some years, questions concerning the laws of God were received from divers lands, but the Supreme Pen did not respond to them; then, in the Land of Mystery, a brief tablet was revealed in the Persian language but was not sent out, and, as directed, it was kept in a safe place. Recently, once again petitions containing questions have reached the Most Holy Threshold. Thereupon this wondrous and sublime Book hath been sent down in the form of Divine verses. As Áqá J. M., upon him rest the glory of God, was on a visit here, that which was suitable for release at present was shared with him; namely, he was permitted to take a copy. God willing, you will receive the Text and act in accordance with wisdom."
