# Unit 2: The Life of the Báb

## Part 1

The Dispensation of the Báb began in 1844 and lasted only nine years. Its primary purpose was to prepare the way for the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Although the period of the Báb’s Ministry was brief, the forces released by His Revelation were so intense that their effect will be felt for hundreds of generations to come.

The Báb, Whose name was Siyyid ‘Alí‑Muḥammad, was born on 20 October 1819 in Shíráz, a city in southern Írán, also known as Persia. Most of the people in Persia belong to a branch of Islám that awaits the appearance of a promised One of God called the Qá’im. The title “Qá’im” means “He Who ariseth”.

The Báb came from a distinguished family that traced its ancestry to Muḥammad, the Prophet of Islám. His father passed away when He was a small child, and He was raised by His maternal uncle. The Báb was endowed with innate knowledge and did not need schooling, yet, abiding by His uncle’s wishes, He entered school at an early age. Soon, however, His teacher recognised the Báb’s great capacity and realised that he had nothing to teach this extraordinary child. He has told the following story about the Báb’s school days:

“One day I asked the Báb to recite the opening words of the Qur’án . . . He hesitated, pleading that unless He were told what the words signified, He would in no wise attempt to pronounce them. I pretended not to know their meaning. ‘I know what these words signify,’ observed my pupil; ‘by your leave, I will explain them.’ He spoke with such knowledge and fluency that I was struck with amazement. . . . The sweetness of His utterance still lingers in my memory. I felt impelled to take Him back to His uncle and to deliver into his hands the Trust he had committed to my care. I determined to tell him how unworthy I felt to teach so remarkable a child. I found His uncle alone in his office. ‘I have brought Him back to you,’ I said, ‘and commit Him to your vigilant protection. He is not to be treated as a mere child, for in Him I can already discern evidences of that mysterious power which the Revelation of the Qá’im alone can reveal. It is incumbent upon you to surround Him with your most loving care. Keep Him in your house, for He, verily, stands in no need of teachers such as I.’ His uncle sternly rebuked the Báb. ‘Have You forgotten my instructions?’ he said. ‘Have I not already admonished You to follow the example of Your fellow‑pupils, to observe silence, and to listen attentively to every word spoken by Your teacher?’ Having obtained His promise to abide faithfully by his instructions, he bade the Báb return to His school. The soul of that child could not, however, be restrained by the stern admonitions of His uncle. No discipline could repress the flow of His intuitive knowledge. Day after day He continued to manifest such remarkable evidences of superhuman wisdom as I am powerless to recount.”

At last the Báb was allowed to leave school. He then began to work with His uncle as a merchant in Búshihr, a city southwest of Shíráz. During that time, the Báb married. He and His wife had a son named Aḥmad, who died in infancy the year before the Báb declared Himself to be the promised Qá’im.

As a youth, the Báb showed signs of a power and greatness that no one could rival. The singular qualities that would distinguish Him throughout His swift and tragic Ministry were already manifest. The Guardian refers to Him as “the gentle, the youthful and irresistible person of the Báb, matchless in His meekness, imperturbable in His serenity, magnetic in His utterance”. The sections that follow can but inadequately describe the events of His life. Yet even this brief account should ignite in our hearts a spark from the fire of love that He enkindled in the hearts of thousands upon thousands in Persia and beyond.

## Part 2

Before the Báb declared His Mission, several people around the world already knew deep in their hearts that a new Day of God was about to dawn. Among them was Siyyid Káẓim, a saintly personage who lived in the city of Karbilá in ‘Iráq. Siyyid Káẓim had many students, and he devoted his life to preparing them for the long‑awaited advent of the Qá’im. He repeatedly told them that, upon his death, they should leave their homes and, with hearts free of all earthly desires, go forth in search of the promised Beloved.

After the passing of Siyyid Káẓim, a most distinguished student of his, Mullá Ḥusayn, spent forty days in prayer and meditation, during which he opened wide his heart to God’s inspiration. He then left ‘Iráq with two companions and began his quest. He went first to Búshihr. He did not remain there long, however, for he felt pulled irresistibly northwards, towards Shíráz. As he approached the city, he asked his two companions to go to a certain mosque and to wait for him to join them there.

A few hours before sunset on that day, just outside the gate of Shíráz, he met a youthful Personage Who welcomed him and invited him to His home to refresh himself following his long and difficult journey. Mullá Ḥusayn was deeply impressed by the gentle yet compelling manner in which this extraordinary Youth spoke. He went with Him, and soon they arrived at the door of a modest house. They entered and proceeded to the upper room. The gracious Host ordered a water‑jug to be brought so that His guest could wash away the dust from his travels. Then, He Himself prepared tea and offered it to Mullá Ḥusayn. After these acts of hospitality, He began to speak. The details of that historic conversation were later recounted by Mullá Ḥusayn:

“It was about an hour after sunset when my youthful Host began to converse with me. ‘Whom, after Siyyid Káẓim,’ He asked me, ‘do you regard as his successor and your leader?’ ‘At the hour of his death,’ I replied, ‘our departed teacher insistently exhorted us to forsake our homes, to scatter far and wide, in quest of the promised Beloved. I have, accordingly, journeyed to Persia, have arisen to accomplish his will, and am still engaged in my quest.’ ‘Has your teacher,’ He further inquired, ‘given you any detailed indications as to the distinguishing features of the promised One?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘He is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious descent, and of the seed of Fáṭimih. As to His age, He is more than twenty and less than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is free from bodily deficiency.’ He paused for a while and then with vibrant voice declared: ‘Behold, all these signs are manifest in Me!’ He then considered each of the above‑mentioned signs separately, and conclusively demonstrated that each and all were applicable to His person.”

That evening, the Báb demonstrated to Mullá Ḥusayn, with clear and unmistakable proofs, that He was the promised Qá’im. He revealed, with astonishing rapidity, the first part of His commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, a significant chapter of the Qur’án. He then addressed Mullá Ḥusayn in these words:

“O thou who art the first to believe in Me! Verily I say, I am the Báb, the Gate of God, and thou art the Bábu’l‑Báb, the gate of that Gate. Eighteen souls must, in the beginning, spontaneously and of their own accord, accept Me and recognise the truth of My Revelation. Unwarned and uninvited, each of these must seek independently to find Me. And when their number is complete, one of them must needs be chosen to accompany Me on My pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. There I shall deliver the Message of God to the Sharíf of Mecca. I then shall return to Kúfih, where again, in the mosque of that holy city, I shall manifest His Cause. It is incumbent upon you not to divulge, either to your companions or to any other soul, that which you have seen and heard.”

This glorious Revelation filled Mullá Ḥusayn’s soul with excitement and joy, with awe and wonder. “How feeble and impotent, how dejected and timid, I had felt previously!” he later said. “Then I could neither write nor walk, so tremulous were my hands and feet. Now, however, the knowledge of His Revelation had galvanised my being. I felt possessed of such courage and power that were the world, all its peoples and its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and undaunted, withstand their onslaught. The universe seemed but a handful of dust in my grasp. I seemed to be the Voice of Gabriel personified, calling unto all mankind: ‘Awake, for, lo! the morning Light has broken. Arise, for His Cause is made manifest. The portal of His grace is open wide; enter therein, O peoples of the world! For He Who is your promised One is come!’”

The Declaration of the Báb took place on the eve of 23 May 1844. He was twenty‑five years old. Decades later, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Báb’s Declaration, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá addressed those gathered in the following words:

“This is 23 May, the anniversary of the message and Declaration of the Báb. It is a blessed day and the dawn of manifestation, for the appearance of the Báb was the early light of the true morn, . . . it is a blessed day, the inception of the heavenly bounty, the beginning of the divine effulgence. On this day in 1844 the Báb was sent forth heralding and proclaiming the Kingdom of God, announcing the glad tidings of the coming of Bahá’u’lláh and withstanding the opposition of the whole Persian nation.”

## Part 3

After Mullá Ḥusayn, seventeen other individuals sought and independently found their heart’s desire, the Báb. Each was guided by God to recognise the truth of the newborn Revelation, some through visions or dreams, some through prayer, and others during moments of meditation. All but one of these blessed souls attained the Báb’s presence in Shíráz. The one who did not meet Him was a brilliant and gifted poetess called Ṭáhirih. She came to know of the Báb through a dream, recognised Him as the promised Qá’im, and became a valiant promoter of His Cause. The eighteenth person to join the ranks of His followers was a twenty‑two‑year‑old youth known as Quddús. Although young, Quddús possessed an exemplary character; few could equal him in courage and faith. These first believers, together with Mullá Ḥusayn, were declared by the Báb the eighteen “Letters of the Living”.

Soon after the number of the Letters of the Living was complete, the Báb called Mullá Ḥusayn to His presence and gave him the following instructions: “The days of our companionship are approaching their end. My Covenant with you is now accomplished. Gird up the loins of endeavour and arise to diffuse My Cause. Be not dismayed at the sight of the degeneracy and perversity of this generation, for the Lord of the Covenant shall assuredly assist you. Verily, He shall surround you with His loving protection, and shall lead you from victory to victory. Even as the cloud that rains its bounty upon the earth, traverse the land from end to end, and shower upon its people the blessings which the Almighty, in His mercy, has deigned to confer upon you. . . . In this pilgrimage upon which We are soon to embark, We have chosen Quddús as Our companion. We have left you behind to face the onslaught of a fierce and relentless enemy. Rest assured, however, that a bounty unspeakably glorious shall be conferred upon you. Follow the course of your journey towards the north, and visit on your way Iṣfáhán, Káshán, Qum, and Ṭihrán. Beseech almighty Providence that He may graciously enable you to attain, in that capital, the seat of true sovereignty, and to enter the mansion of the Beloved. A secret lies hidden in that city. When made manifest, it shall turn the earth into paradise. My hope is that you may partake of its grace and recognise its splendour.”

Having given Mullá Ḥusayn instructions to go to Ṭihrán, the Báb summoned the other Letters of the Living to His presence and assigned to each one a special mission. In His parting words, He called upon them to lay aside every earthly desire and scatter far and wide to proclaim His Cause. He addressed them saying:

“O My beloved friends! You are the bearers of the name of God in this Day. You have been chosen as the repositories of His mystery. It behoves each one of you to manifest the attributes of God, and to exemplify by your deeds and words the signs of His righteousness, His power and glory. The very members of your body must bear witness to the loftiness of your purpose, the integrity of your life, the reality of your faith, and the exalted character of your devotion. For verily I say, this is the Day spoken of by God in His Book: ‘On that day will We set a seal upon their mouths; yet shall their hands speak unto Us, and their feet shall bear witness to that which they shall have done.’ Ponder the words of Jesus addressed to His disciples, as He sent them forth to propagate the Cause of God. In words such as these, He bade them arise and fulfil their mission: ‘Ye are even as the fire which in the darkness of the night has been kindled upon the mountaintop. Let your light shine before the eyes of men. Such must be the purity of your character and the degree of your renunciation, that the people of the earth may through you recognise and be drawn closer to the heavenly Father who is the Source of purity and grace. For none has seen the Father who is in heaven. You who are His spiritual children must by your deeds exemplify His virtues, and witness to His glory. You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? Such must be the degree of your detachment, that into whatever city you enter to proclaim and teach the Cause of God, you should in no wise expect either meat or reward from its people. Nay, when you depart out of that city, you should shake the dust from off your feet. As you have entered it pure and undefiled, so must you depart from that city. For verily I say, the heavenly Father is ever with you and keeps watch over you. If you be faithful to Him, He will assuredly deliver into your hands all the treasures of the earth, and will exalt you above all the rulers and kings of the world.’ O My Letters! Verily I say, immensely exalted is this Day above the days of the Apostles of old. Nay, immeasurable is the difference! You are the witnesses of the Dawn of the promised Day of God. You are the partakers of the mystic chalice of His Revelation. Gird up the loins of endeavour, and be mindful of the words of God as revealed in His Book: ‘Lo, the Lord thy God is come, and with Him is the company of His angels arrayed before Him!’ Purge your hearts of worldly desires, and let angelic virtues be your adorning. Strive that by your deeds you may bear witness to the truth of these words of God, and beware lest, by ‘turning back,’ He may ‘change you for another people,’ who ‘shall not be your like,’ and who shall take from you the Kingdom of God. The days when idle worship was deemed sufficient are ended. The time is come when naught but the purest motive, supported by deeds of stainless purity, can ascend to the throne of the Most High and be acceptable unto Him. ‘The good word riseth up unto Him, and the righteous deed will cause it to be exalted before Him.’ You are the lowly, of whom God has thus spoken in His Book: ‘And We desire to show favour to those who were brought low in the land, and to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make them Our heirs.’ You have been called to this station; you will attain to it, only if you arise to trample beneath your feet every earthly desire, and endeavour to become those ‘honoured servants of His who speak not till He hath spoken, and who do His bidding.’ You are the first Letters that have been generated from the Primal Point, the first Springs that have welled out from the Source of this Revelation. Beseech the Lord your God to grant that no earthly entanglements, no worldly affections, no ephemeral pursuits, may tarnish the purity, or embitter the sweetness, of that grace which flows through you. I am preparing you for the advent of a mighty Day. Exert your utmost endeavour that, in the world to come, I, who am now instructing you, may, before the mercy‑seat of God, rejoice in your deeds and glory in your achievements. The secret of the Day that is to come is now concealed. It can neither be divulged nor estimated. The newly born babe of that Day excels the wisest and most venerable men of this time, and the lowliest and most unlearned of that period shall surpass in understanding the most erudite and accomplished divines of this age. Scatter throughout the length and breadth of this land, and, with steadfast feet and sanctified hearts, prepare the way for His coming. Heed not your weaknesses and frailty; fix your gaze upon the invincible power of the Lord, your God, the Almighty. Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod? Has He not enabled Moses, whose staff was His only companion, to vanquish Pharaoh and his hosts? Has He not established the ascendancy of Jesus, poor and lowly as He was in the eyes of men, over the combined forces of the Jewish people? Has He not subjected the barbarous and militant tribes of Arabia to the holy and transforming discipline of Muḥammad, His Prophet? Arise in His name, put your trust wholly in Him, and be assured of ultimate victory.”

## Part 4

In October 1844 the Báb, accompanied by Quddús, set out for pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. These two cities, located in Saudi Arabia, are considered sacred by the followers of Islám. The Báb and His companion embarked on a vessel in Búshihr, which took them around the Arabian Peninsula, and arrived near Mecca about two months later. While in Mecca, the Báb wrote a letter to the Sharíf, the head of the city and protector of its holy shrine. In that letter, He clearly explained His Mission and called upon the Sharíf to accept His Cause. But the Sharíf, who was busy with his own affairs, failed to respond to the divine Message. The Báb then travelled with Quddús from Mecca to Medina, where the mortal remains of the Prophet Muḥammad are enshrined. After visiting that holy city, they made their way back to Persia by boat. They landed in Búshihr, and the Báb instructed Quddús to proceed to Shíráz:

“The days of your companionship with Me are drawing to a close. The hour of separation has struck, a separation which no reunion will follow except in the Kingdom of God . . . In the streets of Shíráz, indignities will be heaped upon you, and the severest injuries will afflict your body. You will survive the ignominious behaviour of your foes, and will attain the presence of Him who is the one object of our adoration and love. In His presence you will forget all the harm and disgrace that shall have befallen you. The hosts of the Unseen will hasten forth to assist you, and will proclaim to all the world your heroism and glory. Yours will be the ineffable joy of quaffing the cup of martyrdom for His sake. I, too, shall tread the path of sacrifice, and will join you in the realm of eternity.”

## Part 5

In Shíráz, Quddús began to share the Message of the Báb with great fervour. But soon he faced opposition from the Islámic clergy and the governor of the province, who ordered his arrest, along with two of his companions. A cruel and wicked man, the governor commanded that they be publicly punished. Their beards were burnt, and their noses pierced and threaded with a cord, and then, in this disgraceful condition, they were led through the streets. “It will be an object lesson to the people of Shíráz,” was the decree of the governor, “who will know what the penalty of heresy will be.” After suffering such indignities, Quddús and his companions were expelled from the city, having been warned they would be put to death if they attempted to return. Thus did these heroic souls earn the honour of being the first to face persecution in Persia for the sake of their new Faith. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has referred to the thousands who would later be persecuted in the path of their Beloved, the Báb, in these words:

“. . . they suffered the most grievous difficulties and severe ordeals. They withstood the tests with wonderful power and sublime heroism. Thousands were cast into prison, punished, persecuted and martyred. Their homes were pillaged and destroyed, their possessions confiscated. They sacrificed their lives most willingly and remained unshaken in their faith to the very end. Those wonderful souls are the lamps of God, the stars of sanctity shining gloriously from the eternal horizon of the will of God.”

Having ordered so unjust a punishment for Quddús and his companions, the governor turned his anger towards the Báb. He sent his guards on horseback to Búshihr with instructions to arrest Him and bring Him in chains to Shíráz. In the meantime, the Báb had left Búshihr for Shíráz by horse. It was in the wilderness between these two cities that the mounted escort met Him. Much later, the leader of the escort told the story of that encounter:

“As we approached him, he saluted us and inquired as to our destination. I thought it best to conceal from him the truth, and replied that in this vicinity we had been commanded by the governor to conduct a certain inquiry. He smilingly observed: ‘The governor has sent you to arrest Me. Here am I; do with Me as you please. By coming out to meet you, I have curtailed the length of your march, and have made it easier for you to find Me.’ I was startled by his remarks and marvelled at his candour and straightforwardness. I could not explain, however, his readiness to subject himself, of his own accord, to the severe discipline of government officials, and to risk thereby his own life and safety. I tried to ignore him, and was preparing to leave, when he approached me and said: ‘I swear by the righteousness of Him who created man, distinguished him from among the rest of His creatures, and caused his heart to be made the seat of His sovereignty and knowledge, that all My life I have uttered no word but the truth, and had no other desire except the welfare and advancement of My fellow‑men. I have disdained My own ease and have avoided being the cause of pain or sorrow to anyone. I know that you are seeking Me. I prefer to deliver Myself into your hands, rather than subject you and your companions to unnecessary annoyance for My sake.’ These words moved me profoundly. I instinctively dismounted from my horse, and, kissing his stirrups, addressed him in these words: ‘O light of the eyes of the Prophet of God! I adjure you, by Him who has created you and endowed you with such loftiness and power, to grant my request and to answer my prayer. I beseech you to escape from this place and to flee from the ruthless and despicable governor of this province. I dread his machinations against you; I rebel at the idea of being made the instrument of his malignant designs against so innocent and noble a descendant of the Prophet of God. . . .’ To my earnest entreaty he gave this answer: ‘May the Lord your God requite you for your magnanimity and noble intention. No one knows the mystery of My Cause; no one can fathom its secrets. Never will I turn My face away from the decree of God. He alone is My sure Stronghold, My Stay and My Refuge. Until My last hour is at hand, none dare assail Me, none can frustrate the plan of the Almighty. And when My hour is come, how great will be My joy to quaff the cup of martyrdom in His name! Here am I; deliver Me into the hands of your master. Be not afraid, for no one will blame you.’ I bowed my consent and carried out his desire.”

The Báb immediately continued on His journey to Shíráz. Free and without chains, He went before His escort, which followed Him respectfully. Arriving in Shíráz, the Báb was brought in front of the governor, who treated Him with shameful cruelty. He publicly rebuked and criticised the Báb. He then released Him into the custody of His uncle. Although the Báb was allowed to return to His home, His freedom was restricted. Only the members of His family and a few others were permitted to see Him. Yet, in spite of attempts by the governor and the clergy to put an end to His influence, the number of His followers rapidly rose.

News of the Báb’s momentous Declaration became so widespread that the king of Persia decided to send one of his most trusted and knowledgeable scholars to Shíráz to investigate the situation. A guest in the home of the governor himself, this learned man met with the Báb on three occasions. He was determined to refute the Báb’s arguments, but at each meeting he grew increasingly impressed by His knowledge, eloquence and wisdom. By the third meeting, Vaḥíd—the name by which this scholar would become known—was utterly convinced of the Youth’s divine Station. Vaḥíd would later explain that, during his meetings with the Báb, he felt as “lowly as the dust beneath His feet”. He immediately sent a written report to the king’s court and left Shíráz at the instructions of the Báb. From that day forward, he dedicated his energies to the promotion of His Cause and eventually laid down his life in the path of his Beloved.

With the Báb’s rising popularity and fame, the governor’s anger mounted. He again ordered His arrest. This time the governor intended to put the Báb to death, and he sent off a police official to seize Him from His uncle’s home in the middle of the night. On that very night, however, a plague broke out in Shíráz and the entire city was thrown into a state of panic. Within a few hours, over a hundred people had died from the dreaded disease. Screams of pain and grief could be heard in the streets, and the inhabitants of the city were fleeing in confusion. Unsure what to do, the official brought the Báb to his own home. He was distressed to learn upon his arrival that his son was dying from the disease. In despair he threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged to be forgiven. When his son was miraculously cured, the official recognised the Hand of God in the outbreak and pleaded with the governor to release the Báb. The governor, fearing for the lives of his family and others, accepted on condition that the Báb would leave Shíráz.

In the fall of 1846 the Báb departed for Iṣfáhán, a city north of Shíráz. As He said farewell to His uncle, He told him: “I will again meet you amid the mountains of Ádhirbáyján, from whence I will send you forth to obtain the crown of martyrdom. I Myself will follow you, together with one of My loyal disciples, and will join you in the realm of eternity.”

## Part 6

As the Báb neared the city of Iṣfáhán, He wrote a letter to the governor of that province asking him to designate the place where He should live. This governor, who was purehearted and just, was so moved by the courtesy and style of the Báb’s letter that he instructed the highest religious official of the province to receive the Báb in his home and to give Him a warm and generous reception.

During the Báb’s stay in Iṣfáhán, crowds of people came to see Him every day and listen to His words. His growing influence, however, soon aroused the jealousy of the local clergy, who feared losing the position of power and authority that they had long occupied. They began to spread rumours about the Báb, hoping to excite suspicion against Him. When this failed, they devised a plan to do away with Him. The governor, aware of the clergy’s schemes, invited the Báb to stay in his own home. There, during hours spent in conversation with Him, the governor came to understand the greatness of His Revelation. One day, while seated with the Báb in the garden of his home, the governor addressed Him in these words:

“The almighty Giver has endowed me with great riches. I know not how best to use them. Now that I have, by the aid of God, been led to recognise this Revelation, it is my ardent desire to consecrate all my possessions to the furtherance of its interests and the spread of its fame. It is my intention to proceed, by Your leave, to Ṭihrán, and to do my best to win to this Cause the king, whose confidence in me is firm and unshaken.”

To this outpouring of love and devotion, the Báb replied:

“May God requite you for your noble intentions. So lofty a purpose is to Me even more precious than the act itself. Your days and Mine are numbered, however; they are too short to enable Me to witness, and allow you to achieve, the realisation of your hopes. Not by the means which you fondly imagine will an almighty Providence accomplish the triumph of His Faith. Through the poor and lowly of this land, by the blood which these shall have shed in His path, will the omnipotent Sovereign ensure the preservation and consolidate the foundation of His Cause. That same God will, in the world to come, place upon your head the crown of immortal glory, and will shower upon you His inestimable blessings. Of the span of your earthly life there remain only three months and nine days, after which you shall, with faith and certitude, hasten to your eternal abode.”

Three months and nine days later the governor of Iṣfáhán passed away, exactly as the Báb had foretold. Shortly after his death, his successor sent a message to the king in Ṭihrán asking him what he should do with the Báb. The king ordered him to send the Báb in disguise to the capital, where the king intended to meet Him. Thus, in the company of a mounted escort, the Báb began His journey towards Ṭihrán.

## Part 7

The prime minister of Persia at that time was a selfish and incompetent man. He was afraid that, if the Báb came to Ṭihrán and met the king, he would lose his own position and power. Therefore, he convinced the king to change his orders and send the Báb to the province of Ádhirbáyján in the northwest of the country.

Arriving under escort in Tabríz, the capital of the province, in June 1847, the Báb was conducted to a house that had been chosen for His confinement. A detachment of soldiers guarded the entrance of the house. No one was permitted to see Him, except two of His followers. The people of the city were warned that whoever tried to meet the Báb would be thrown into prison and all his possessions would be seized.

The Báb stayed in Tabríz for a short time and was then transferred to the fortress of Máh‑Kú, situated in the mountains of Ádhirbáyján far away from large cities and towns. The prime minister had thought that, banished to this remote and inhospitable corner of the country, the Báb would lose His influence and His Faith would be forgotten. But he did not realise that, once the lamp of the religion of God had been lit, no human hand could put out its flame. Through His majesty and loving‑kindness, the Báb soon won the respect and admiration of both the official in charge of the fortress and the people of the region.

Thus were the severe restrictions placed on the Báb gradually relaxed and the doors of the fortress opened to His followers, who arrived in increasing numbers from different parts of Persia to see Him. During the period of His imprisonment in Máh‑Kú, the Báb revealed the Persian Bayán, the most important of all His works. In that book, He established the laws of His Dispensation, plainly and directly announced the advent of another Revelation greater than His Own, and urged His followers to seek and find “Him Whom God shall make manifest”. One of the early believers who lived in Máh‑Kú at the time described the revelation of the Persian Bayán in these words:

“The voice of the Báb, as He dictated the teachings and principles of His Faith, could be clearly heard by those who were dwelling at the foot of the mountain. The melody of His chanting, the rhythmic flow of the verses which streamed from His lips caught our ears and penetrated into our very souls. Mountain and valley reechoed the majesty of His voice. Our hearts vibrated in their depths to the appeal of His utterance.”

When the prime minister learned that the Báb had won the love and support of the people of Máh‑Kú and that His Faith was continuing to spread throughout the country, he issued an order for the Báb to be transferred to the fortress of Chihríq. There too, however, the people of the surrounding towns and the official of the fortress were attracted to the magnetic personality of the Báb. Even some of the most distinguished clergymen of the region accepted the new Faith and left their privileged positions to join the ranks of His followers.

As soon as the prime minister heard about events unfolding in Chihríq, he gave orders to have the Báb sent immediately to Tabríz. A meeting of the religious authorities was called to examine the Báb and find an effective way to put an end to His influence. It was now around July 1848. At that meeting, the clergy and government officials tried to humiliate the Báb but were overpowered by His majesty. When asked, “Whom do you claim to be, and what is the message which you have brought?” He declared:

“I am, I am, I am the Promised One! I am the One Whose name you have for a thousand years invoked, at Whose mention you have risen, Whose advent you have longed to witness, and the hour of Whose Revelation you have prayed God to hasten. Verily, I say, it is incumbent upon the peoples of both the East and the West to obey My word and to pledge allegiance to My person.”

A few days after the meeting, the Báb was taken back to Chihríq. His enemies had hoped that, in Tabríz, they would force Him to give up His Mission. But in the end they decided that, as long as the Báb remained alive, it would be impossible to stem the tide of His rising influence among the people of Persia.

## Part 8

Referring to the Báb, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states:

“As for the Báb—may my soul be His sacrifice!—it was at a young age, that is, in the twenty‑fifth year of His blessed life, that He arose to proclaim His Cause. . . . Alone, He undertook a task that can scarcely be conceived, for the Persians are known throughout the world for their religious fanaticism. This illustrious Being arose with such power as to shake the foundations of the religious laws, customs, manners, morals, and habits of Persia, and instituted a new law, faith, and religion. Though the eminent men of the State, the majority of the people, and the leaders of religion arose one and all to destroy and annihilate Him, He single‑handedly withstood them and set all of Persia in motion. How numerous the divines, the leaders, and the inhabitants of that land who with perfect joy and gladness offered up their lives in His path and hastened to the field of martyrdom!

“The government, the nation, the clergy, and prominent leaders sought to extinguish His light, but to no avail. At last His moon rose, His star shone forth, His foundation was secured, and His horizon was flooded with light. He trained a large multitude through divine education and exerted a marvellous influence upon the thoughts, customs, morals, and manners of the Persians. He proclaimed the glad‑tidings of the manifestation of the Sun of Bahá to all His followers and readied them for faith and certitude.

“The manifestation of such marvellous signs and mighty undertakings, the influence exerted upon the thoughts and minds of the people, the laying of the foundations of progress, and the establishment of the prerequisites of success and prosperity by a young merchant constitute the greatest proof that He was a universal Educator—a fact that no fair‑minded person would ever hesitate to acknowledge.”

## Part 9

In the year 1850, the new prime minister of Persia, as bloodthirsty as the previous one, ordered the execution of the Báb. Again, the Báb was brought from Chihríq to Tabríz, where He was placed in a cell next to a courtyard that was to be the scene of His martyrdom.

As the Báb was being conducted to the cell, a youth forced his way through the crowd and threw himself at the feet of the Báb. “Send me not from Thee, O Master,” pleaded the youth. He begged the Báb to be allowed to follow Him wherever He might go. “Arise,” answered the Báb, “and rest assured that you will be with Me. Tomorrow you shall witness what God has decreed.” The youth was immediately arrested, together with two of his companions, and taken to the same cell in which the Báb and His secretary were confined. This young man became known as Anís.

Anís had learned of the new Message from the Báb Himself during His first brief stay in Tabríz—this, in spite of the severe restrictions that, at the time, had been imposed on His contact with the city’s inhabitants. So strong was the fire of the love of God burning in Anís’ heart that his only desire was to sacrifice himself for his new Faith. But his stepfather, alarmed at his son’s behaviour, restricted Anís’ movements and kept him under strict watch in his home. There Anís spent weeks in prayer and meditation, imploring God to allow him to attain, once again, the presence of his Beloved. One day, while lost in prayer, he had an extraordinary vision. He saw the Báb standing before him and calling to him. Anís threw himself at His feet. “Rejoice,” the Báb said to him, “the hour is approaching when, in this very city, I shall be suspended before the eyes of the multitude and shall fall a victim to the fire of the enemy. I shall choose no one except you to share with Me the cup of martyrdom. Rest assured that this promise which I give you shall be fulfilled.” And so Anís began to wait patiently, knowing that the day would soon arrive when he would be reunited with his Beloved. Now, at last, he had attained his heart’s desire.

That evening the Báb was aglow with joy. He spoke with cheerfulness to Anís and the other three loyal followers with Him in His prison cell. “Tomorrow,” He said to them, “will be the day of My martyrdom. Would that one of you might now arise and, with his own hands, end My life. I prefer to be slain by the hand of a friend rather than by that of the enemy.” None of them could think of taking so precious a life, and they remained silent, tears running from their eyes. Then, suddenly, Anís sprang to his feet and said he was ready to obey whatever the Báb might command. “This same youth who has risen to comply with My wish,” the Báb declared, “will, together with Me, suffer martyrdom. Him will I choose to share with Me its crown.”

Early the next morning, on 9 July 1850, the Báb was working with His secretary when an official suddenly interrupted their conversation. “Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish to say,” the Báb told the official, “can any earthly power silence Me. Though all the world be armed against Me, yet shall they be powerless to deter Me from fulfilling, to the last word, My intention.” But the official did not understand the significance of the Báb’s words. He made no reply and instructed the secretary to follow him. The Báb was then taken from His cell to the homes of the three most high‑ranking clergymen in the city who, without hesitation, signed the decree for His execution.

Later that morning the Báb was conducted back to the courtyard where a crowd of nearly ten thousand people had gathered on the rooftops to witness His execution. He was delivered into the hands of Sám Khán, the commander of the regiment of soldiers ordered to execute Him. But Sám Khán was ill at ease. He was seized with fear that his actions would bring the wrath of God upon him. “I profess the Christian Faith,” he explained to the Báb, “and entertain no ill will against you. If your Cause be the Cause of Truth, enable me to free myself from the obligation to shed your blood.” “Follow your instructions,” the Báb replied, “and if your intention be sincere, the Almighty is surely able to relieve you from your perplexity.”

Sám Khán ordered his men to drive an iron nail into the wall and attach two ropes to it. From these ropes, the Báb and Anís were suspended. The regiment then arranged itself in three rows, each of two hundred and fifty men. One after the other, each row opened fire. When the smoke from the seven hundred and fifty rifles cleared away, the astonished crowd beheld a scene they could hardly believe. Anís was standing before them alive and unhurt, and the Báb had disappeared from their sight. The bullets had only cut the ropes from which they had been suspended. A frantic search for the Báb began. Eventually He was found seated in His cell, completing His interrupted conversation with His secretary. “I have finished My conversation,” the Báb said. “Now you may proceed to fulfil your intention.”

Stunned by what had taken place, Sám Khán refused to allow his men to bring injury to the Báb and ordered them to leave the courtyard. Another regiment was called up to carry out the execution. Once more the Báb and Anís were suspended in the courtyard, and the soldiers opened fire. This time the bullets found their mark. The bodies of the Báb and Anís were completely shattered; yet their faces remained almost untouched. As the regiment was preparing to open fire, the Báb addressed these final words to the gazing multitude:

“O wayward generation! Had you believed in Me every one of you would have followed the example of this youth, who stood in rank above most of you, and willingly would have sacrificed himself in My path. The day will come when you will have recognised Me; that day I shall have ceased to be with you.”

## Part 10

In this unit, you have learned about the life of one of the Twin Manifestations of God for this Day. During His brief Ministry, the Báb created a spiritual revolution in Persia. Thousands upon thousands of pure souls accepted His Message and began to prepare themselves for the coming of the Manifestation of God referred to by the Báb as “Him Whom God shall make manifest”. You know that, whenever a Manifestation of God appears on earth, those who thirst after power and leadership arise against Him and try to extinguish the light of His Revelation. In this case, not only was the Báb martyred by the ignorant leaders of Persia, but thousands of His followers were put to death. The heroic lives of these early Bábís, who watered the tree of the newborn Revelation with their blood, will be the subject of your study in the years to come. Figures such as Mullá Ḥusayn, Quddús, Ṭáhirih, and Vaḥíd will be a source of inspiration and courage to you throughout your life as you continue to learn about the extraordinary history of the early years of the Bahá’í Era. For now, we would do well to reflect on one fundamental question: How, in the space of such a short time, could the lives of so many thousands of people have been utterly transformed and, from among a population steeped in superstition and enslaved by corrupt leaders, could such holy souls have arisen to perform deeds of exceptional heroism? The answer can only be found in the Person of ‘Alí‑Muḥammad, the Báb. It is suggested, then, that you study and meditate on certain passages from the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, and the Guardian about that Holy Being.

In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states:

“This is the foundation of the belief of the people of Bahá (may my life be offered up for them): ‘His Holiness, the Exalted One (the Báb), is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abhá Beauty (may my life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All others are servants unto Him and do His bidding.’”

In God Passes By, we read the following passage written by the Guardian:

“The Báb, acclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh as the ‘Essence of Essences,’ the ‘Sea of Seas,’ the ‘Point round Whom the realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve,’ ‘from Whom God hath caused to proceed the knowledge of all that was and shall be,’ Whose ‘rank excelleth that of all the Prophets,’ and Whose ‘Revelation transcendeth the comprehension and understanding of all their chosen ones,’ had delivered His Message and discharged His mission. He Who was, in the words of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, the ‘Morn of Truth’ and ‘Harbinger of the Most Great Light,’ Whose advent at once signalised the termination of the ‘Prophetic Cycle’ and the inception of the ‘Cycle of Fulfilment,’ had simultaneously through His Revelation banished the shades of night that had descended upon His country, and proclaimed the impending rise of that Incomparable Orb Whose radiance was to envelop the whole of mankind.”

Bahá’u’lláh Himself explains:

“That so brief a span should have separated this most mighty and wondrous Revelation from Mine own previous Manifestation, is a secret that no man can unravel and a mystery such as no mind can fathom.”

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states:

“The appearance of the Báb resembles the dawn, for the dawn holds the promise of the sun. The dawn of the Báb promised the rising of the Sun of Truth that is to envelop the whole world.”
