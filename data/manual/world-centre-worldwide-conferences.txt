# Bahá’u’lláh’s vision for humanity

## Large group discussion

### The purpose of humanity/creation (i.e., true religion)

Bahá’u’lláh states that “the purpose for which mortal men have, from utter nothingness, stepped into the realm of being, is that they may work for the betterment of the world and live together in concord and harmony.” He has revealed teachings that make this possible.

Building a society that consciously pursues this collective purpose is the work of not only this generation, but of many generations to come, and Bahá’u’lláh’s followers welcome all who labour alongside them in this undertaking.

### Raising vibrant communities that are contributing to spiritual and material progress

It means learning how to raise up vibrant, outward‑looking communities; it means those communities learning how to bring about spiritual and material progress; it means learning how to contribute to the discourses that influence the direction of that progress.

A vision of personal and collective transformation occurring simultaneously, founded on study of the Word of God and an appreciation of each person’s capacity to become a protagonist in a profound spiritual drama, had given rise to a sense of common endeavour.

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá explains that the more the qualities of cooperation and mutual assistance are manifested by a people, “the more will human society advance in progress and prosperity.”

### What Bahá’ís and those labouring alongside them are doing

The enkindled souls being raised up through the processes of the Plan . . . are committed to the prosperity of all, recognising that the welfare of individuals rests in the welfare of society at large . . . they are focused on transcending differences, harmonising perspectives, and promoting the use of consultation for making decisions. They emphasise qualities and attitudes—such as trustworthiness, cooperation, and forbearance—that are building blocks of a stable social order. They champion rationality and science as essential for human progress.

. . . where growing numbers are helping to build communities of this character, the power of the Cause to transform people’s social existence, as well as their inner lives, is becoming increasingly visible.

The families and individuals participating should consult on where they want to go from here and identify the necessary next steps. The use of the arts here could be a way to engage all the participants.

# Building vibrant communities

## Large group discussion

### The characteristics of a vibrant community

. . .Bahá’ís are engaged in cities and villages across the globe in establishing a pattern of life in which increasing numbers, irrespective of background, are invited to take part . . . This pattern of community life is giving rise to vibrant and purposeful new communities wherein relationships are founded on the oneness of mankind, universal participation, justice, and freedom from prejudice. All are welcome.

[From the collective experiences of Bahá’í communities around the world] it was recognised that certain [community‑building] activities were a natural response to the spiritual needs of a population. Study circles, children’s classes, devotional meetings, and later junior youth groups stood out as being of central importance in this regard, and when woven together with related activities, the dynamics generated could give rise to a vibrant pattern of community life.

. . .a rising spirit of universal participation in the work of community building . . . entails families and individual believers working together and making a conscious decision to see themselves as belonging to an expanding nucleus. Such groups of friends set about widening the circle of participation in their activities by engaging with the networks to which they belong—networks created through a place of work or study, a local school, or a community hub of another kind—and by accompanying others who arise to serve alongside them. These efforts have tremendous merit.

Within each centre of intense activity, collaborative arrangements emerge among groups of families, who organise community‑building activities among themselves with a view to widening the embrace of such activities to many nearby households; an informal network of friends provides encouragement and support to the endeavours under way.

* Note: Individuals could be identified ahead of time to share experiences of the transformation of individuals, groups, and segments of the community that have been observed as a result of the community‑building process. This will help highlight the characteristics of a vibrant community in a practical way.

### Importance of worship and service, and contributing to the wellbeing of everyone

The character of daily life in such places [centres of intense activity] is adapting to the rise of a culture in which worship and service are cherished activities involving many people at once. Uplifting, well‑prepared community gatherings—extending in some cases to camps and festivals—occur with increasing frequency, and music and song feature prominently on such occasions. Indeed the arts as a whole, so integral a part of the development of a community from the start, stand out in such settings as an important means of generating joy, strengthening bonds of unity, disseminating knowledge, and consolidating understanding, as well as of acquainting those in the wider society with the principles of the Cause.

The systematic pursuit of the Plan . . . gives rise to a pattern of collective endeavour distinguished not only for its commitment to service, but also for its attraction to worship. . . . witness, for instance, how gatherings for worship have been integrated into the core of community life. Devotional meetings are occasions where any soul may enter, inhale the heavenly fragrances, experience the sweetness of prayer, meditate upon the Creative Word, be transported on the wings of the spirit, and commune with the one Beloved. Feelings of fellowship and common cause are generated, particularly in the spiritually heightened conversations that naturally occur at such times and through which the “city of the human heart” may be opened.

. . . in such locations, the thoughts of the friends labouring at the grassroots are increasingly occupied with the progress and well‑being of everyone dwelling in the vicinity. Bahá’í institutions feel more keenly their responsibility for the spiritual education of an entire generation of children and junior youth, most or even all of whom might already be engaged in community activities.

# Educational endeavours and the training institute

## Large group discussion

### The centrality of education

The importance of education to a Bahá’í conception of spiritual and social transformation can hardly be overestimated. “Consider”, Bahá’u’lláh states, “the revelation of the light of the Name of God, the Educator.”

Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.

As to divine education, it is the education of the Kingdom and consists in acquiring divine perfections. This is indeed true education, for by its virtue man becomes the focal centre of divine blessings and the embodiment of the verse “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness.” This is the ultimate goal of the world of humanity.

The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward.

### The importance of the institute process in building both the capacity for service and the ability to contribute to the development of the local community and society

The significance of education in the work of community building is unmistakable, and in the field of social action the provision of education remains the signature contribution of Bahá’ís in most parts of the world. Preeminent among the structures and agencies created by the Bahá’í world to offer education is, of course, the training institute.

We may think of the work of the training institute, then, as maintaining a system of distance education to fuel and facilitate this evolving conversation [concerned with the advancement of society through the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh]. The principal elements of the system include the “study circle”, the tutor, and a set of materials, grounded in the Bahá’í writings, that express the spiritual insights and the knowledge gained in the process of translating Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings into reality [for the development of their own community as well as for the progress of society].

The training institute has no parallel as an instrument for the systematic exposure of limitless numbers of souls to the life‑giving waters of the Revelation and the inexhaustible meaning of the Word of God.

. . . participation in institute courses is preparing the friends of God for an everdeeper engagement in the life of the wider community; it is endowing them with the knowledge, insights, and skills that enable them to contribute not only to the process of developing their own community, but to the progress of society. In short, the institute is a potent means for the society‑building power of the Faith to find release.

* Note: Individuals could be identified ahead of time to present their experiences and ways the institute process has given them knowledge, skills, and insights to serve the community. Parents could be identified to share examples of the transformations they have observed in their children, junior youth, and families through engagement with the programmes offered by the training institute.

### Educational programmes of the institute

[The materials of the training institute] offer a seamless coherent educational experience from the age of five, upwards to the age of junior youth, and through into adulthood, and they serve as a direct counterpart to the pattern of activities unfolding at the grassroots.

The educational programmes offered by the training institute include classes for the spiritual education of children, the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme and study circles:

[Children’s classes establish a] sustainable system for child education that will keep pace with both the growing concern among parents for their youngsters to develop sound moral structures and the rise in human resources in the community.

. . . the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme [is] imbued with a strong twofold purpose, both to develop their inherent potentialities [of junior youth] and to contribute to the transformation of society.

A study circle is a small group that meets [regularly] . . . to study the course materials. Anyone aged fifteen or older, whether a Bahá’í or not, is welcome to take part. The group is brought together by a tutor associated with the training institute. . . . All those participating are seen as active agents of their own learning, and tutors strive to create an atmosphere that encourages individuals to assume ownership for the educational process in which they are engaged. A study circle should be a space that leads to the spiritual and moral empowerment of individuals.

### Youth: the sacred charge of the institute

Institutes know well that releasing the potential possessed by young people is, for them, a sacred charge; we now ask that Bahá’í youth view the future development of the institute in the very same light. . . . They should seize every opportunity—in their schools and universities, and in spaces dedicated to work, family, or social interaction—to encourage more and more souls to benefit from the institute’s programmes. Some youth will be able to devote a period of service—perhaps even successive years—to the provision of education, especially to those younger than themselves; for many, support for the institute’s activities will be an ever‑present dimension of their lives throughout their own education and as they seek a livelihood from their calling in this world; but for none should it be anything less than a cherished commitment.

# Contributing to social transformation

## Large group discussion

### Becoming protagonists of our own development and that of our communities

The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is concerned with the transformation of both humanity’s inner life and social environment. . . . The contribution made by Bahá’ís is distinguished by its focus on building capacity for service; it is an approach founded on faith in the ability of a population to become the protagonists of their own development.

Capacity building is the watchword of these plans: they aim at enabling the protagonists of collective effort to strengthen the spiritual foundations of villages and neighbourhoods, to address certain of their social and economic needs, and to contribute to the discourses prevalent in society, all while maintaining the necessary coherence in methods and approaches.

* Note: Individuals, including youth and parents, could share a presentation on how participation in the institute process has enabled them to become protagonists of their own development and equipped them to serve their local communities through social action and contributing to discourses in society.

### Social action

Most appropriately conceived in terms of a spectrum, social action can range from fairly informal efforts of limited duration undertaken by individuals or small groups of friends to programmes of social and economic development with a high level of complexity and sophistication implemented by Bahá’í‑inspired organisations. Irrespective of its scope and scale, all social action seeks to apply the teachings and principles of the Faith to improve some aspect of the social or economic life of a population, however modestly. Such endeavours are distinguished, then, by their stated purpose to promote the material well‑being of the population, in addition to its spiritual welfare.

### Participating in discourses of society

Closely connected with the capacity for engaging in social action is a capacity for contributing to the discourses of society. At heart, this is simply a capacity for participating in a conversation about a matter that affects people’s lives and offering a perspective grounded in Bahá’í principles and Bahá’í experience. Viewed in this way, it is a skill which many Bahá’ís have the opportunity to practise almost daily, for instance in their studies or occupations, and which is cultivated through involvement in institute courses. . . . Opportunities are sought out to share the perspectives of the Faith with community leaders and figures in authority, and spaces are created in which representatives of various groups and interests can be assisted to reach a common point of view through consultation.
